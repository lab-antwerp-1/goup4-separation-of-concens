# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Render component is too big. could be refracted into more smaller functions
- Create html 'skeleton' for elements that will be modified in render component
- Write handlers for same elements on separate files

## Continue Doing

- Keep up good group collaboration and communication
- Setting realistic goals and time management

## Start Doing

- Use `SVG` instead of `img` elements from the start
- Normalize css for different browsers

## Lessons Learned

- Make sure we understand the design before we begin to write code
- Managing indexed ids and working with `event.target`
- Assigning ids and class names in js

---

## Strategy vs. Board

- It is useful to decide in advance on the names of branches and key words like ids, class names and elements.
- A lot of the class names for css were changed from the original. Not as useful as other planning features.
- The issues and project board helped to keep the workflow organized. Everybody knew what they are working on, and what other team members were doing as well.
- After a section of code was done it was easy and fast to create and send a pull request with the pre-made labels and issues

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We followed the plan pretty well. We completed all of the 'must have' issues and got a working page
- We also completed a few of the 'should have' issues and even some 'could have's

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Some 'could have' and 'should have' issues are still incomplete. The page is not perfect
- We had some problems with styling the buttons in `css` and `js`. Still trying to solve this problem

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We had to add a lot of the `js` ids and methods that we used. We did not know what they will be when we first planned our strategy
